        Drop Down with JSON data
        This experiment shows how to populate the drop down with JSON data stored in seperate files.
        We have a list of countries and the country code saved in seperate file called data.txt.
        A data model is bound to the select clause.The controller parses the data from the JSON file and assignes it
        to the countries model. This dropdown is populated with the name of countries from this data model.
        When we select a country , we are displaying the value of the selected country below.

        Counter and hide /show images
        The above experiment demonstrates the use ng-click, ng-show and ng-hide.
        A counter is implemented using ng-click. The value of the counter increments on every click
        and the value is displayed on UI.ng-show and ng-hide are used to show/hide tags.The show/hide model bound with
        the checkbox.On checking the checkbox the images are shown / hidden

        Controller in angular JS
        This experiment shows how to define a controller that manipulates the model.
        The first name and last name input field are bound too the field of student model.
        We have defined a student controller which works on student. The controller has a function
        fullname that computes the full name of the student. This function is called in the div where the controller scope is defined
        where we print the full name of the student.

        Validation in Angular JS
        The above experiment demonstrates validation for input fields using Angular.The example maintains the angular js application
        in a seperate file.This is done by declaring the ng-app field for the div and calling the controller of the module
        using this field.The $dirty and $error states are used to validate data and track the errors.These states are shown using the ng-show
        field in the span tag. The validation are provided for empty fields.

        Routing in Angular
        Angular js has feature called RouteProvider using which you can embedd and HTML page
        in the current HTML page.For this, we have to configure the config of the mainApp
        and provide the template URl and the controller for click of the link.We also need
        to specify the default URL where the page will be directed incase there are no matched found.
        The page will be viewed in the div for which we have specified the ng-view directive.
