        Drag the Div in the box.
        This is a simple example of the drag and drop feature of HTML5.
        You can drag the box which in the container and drop it right there.This feature can be used in a scenario like
        shopping cart where a person and drag the required items in the shopping basket.
        Code : The ondrag start function is called on the div element which is to be dragged and the draggable property is set to true.
        The drag and drop function is called on the element where the item will be dragged and dropped.
        
        Geolocator:       
        This is a simple example demonstrating how to get a location using HTML5.
        We use the navigation element to check if the Geolocation is supported. If yes we retrieve the current
        co-ordinates and plot it on a map using the google maps API.If not we simply return with and error.

        HTML5 now can help determine if a person is online or offline. The navigator object
        retrieves the status of network connection which can be used to determine if a person is connected
        to the network. In the above example, we are setting the status of the div to Online/Offline.
        We have added event listeners to capture the status.
