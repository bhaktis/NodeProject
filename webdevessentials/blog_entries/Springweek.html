        Researched on the project topics for using MEAN stack 
        and started creating a chat application which would be required as part of the project. 
        The chat application uses Socket IO library. This framework provides with a client and a server API. 
        The client and server api are used to make socket connections and communication with the server. 
        The server will then decide to forward these messages to server.
