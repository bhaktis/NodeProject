        The experiment demonstrates connecting a node server to a MongoDb server.To be able to connect to the mongoDb server
        we need to install the Mangoose utility on the node server. After Install Mongoose we will be able to connect to
        the MOngoDb server.
        The Connection string used to connect to the MongoDb server can either be a locahost server or a link to some other
        server. We have configured mongoDb on the open shift server. For this, We need to install a MongoDb on open shift
        upon which you will receive the server link and the credentials.
        The new developer schema is created mongoose.Schema command where the fields of developer are defined.
        This schema is used to create a developer model.

        Save function:
        Save function is a asyn call that adds the new data to the developer collection.
        Inside this function call we define another functions which will be called on completion of save with the error
        data if any and the resultset after adding the new record. This new resulset is send to the node controller
        which updates the view.

        Update function:
        Update function is a asyn call that updates data in the developer collection.
        The update function take some identifier for the record to be updated and the new values .
        Inside this function call we define another functions which will be called on completion of update with the error
        data if any and the resultset after updating the record. This new resulset is send to the node controller
        which updates the view.

        Find:
        find function returns all the records from the developer collection.
        Inside this function call we define another functions which will be called on completion of find with the error
        data if any and the resultset. This new resulset is send to the node controller which updates the view.

        Delete:
        remove() function is a asyn call that deletes data from the developer collection.
        Inside this function call we define another functions which will be called on completion of remove with the error
        data if any and the resultset with the record deleted. This new resulset is send to the node controller
        which updates the view.
