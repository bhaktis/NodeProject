    This week we will learn Node JS . Node js is server side javascript framework which allows to create a server in few
    easy steps.

   <h1>Fetch data from the server</h1>
  
    The page will fetch the data from the server and display it using angularjs.The developer data consists of the array of developer details (firstName, lastName) stored at the server.We fetch the data using the get http request and bind it to the view.

    This experiment demonstrates how to fetch data from a node js server and bind it to the ng-view attribute. The controller fetches the data using the http get request and binds it to the view in the angular application.

    <h1>
        Add new data
    </h1>
        The page show an data adding functionality to the server using angularjs and node js.The developer data consists of the array of developer details (firstName, lastName) stored at the server.New developer is adding to this list from UI .

        The experiment demonstrates how to add new developer records to data stored in server using angular js.We use the http post method to call a function on the server side and pass the developer object to be added.The server method updated the data set and return the new data set to show in the view.


    <h1>
        Edit data
    </h1>
            The page show an data edit functionality to the server using angularjs and node js.The developer data consists of the array of developer details (firstName, lastName) stored at the server. Edit will edit an existing developer record

            The experiment demonstrates how to edit developer records stored in server using angular js and node js. We use the http post method to call a function on the server side and pass the developer object to be added. The server method updated the data set and return the new data set to show in the view.

    <h1>
        Remove data
    </h1>
                The page show an data deleting functionality to the server using angularjs and node js.The developer data consists of the array of developer details (firstName, lastName) stored at the server. New developer is deleted and the updated list is returned.

                The experiment demonstrates how to delete developer records from data stored in server using angular js. We use the http delete method to call a function on the server side and pass the developer object to be deleted.The server method deletes the data and returns the new data set to show in the view.
