            <p>
                This is a responsive page which will scale according to the brower size.
                It will scale for web / tablet as well as mobile browsers.
                Responsive web design responds to the needs of the user and the devices they are using. 
                With more number of users using smartphone it is a need to design web application that

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                This page demonstrates using HTML and CSS3 for creating responsive web application.
                resize the window and this page will resize itself to fit the window.The viewport meta tag allow the user to 
                specify the content width and scale level amongst many parameters. We set the width to the device width so the application will scale itself 
               to fit in the device. Initial scale is the zoom level which is initially set to 1.
