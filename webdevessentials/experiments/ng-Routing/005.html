        <h3>About the experiment</h3>
        <p>
            The routing functionality added by this step is provided by angular in the ngRoute module, which is distributed separately from the core Angular framework.
            The below experiment we see how to add multiple views to
            a Single page application.The views will be displayed under the same ng-view.           
        </p>

        <div ng-controller="MultipleController">
            {{hello}}
            <div ng-view=""></div>
        </div>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Angular js has feature called RouteProvider using which you can add multiple views in an HTML page.
            For this, we have to configure the config of the mainApp
            and provide the template URl and the controller for click of the link.We also need
            to specify the default URL where the page will be directed incase there are no matched found.
            The page will be viewed in the div for which we have specified the ng-view directive.
