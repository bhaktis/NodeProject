            Need for such a website :

            There is a large section of people in the world which do not have access to the basic aminities
            food , clothing , shelter , education.
            Many people today want to help this section but are unable to do so because of one the many reasons.
            One of the many reasone being time to invest.

            We are trying to take away that component by providing an web portal where people can shop from existing
            shopping sites and have the things delivered to the organisation.

            Also, nowadays many of the occasions like wedding and social gathering
            food goes to waste .People can contact a nearest organistion on the web app and have them pick -up the food or deliver it to the required location.
